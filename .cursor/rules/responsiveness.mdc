# Responsiveness Guidelines

This app implements a responsive design approach to ensure proper display across different device sizes and orientations:

## Core Responsive Principles
- Use of MediaQuery to obtain device dimensions (`MediaQuery.of(context).size`)
- Relative sizing with multipliers (e.g., `size.width * 0.65`)
- Flexible layouts using Expanded and Flexible widgets
- Consistent spacing using the app's spacing system

## Screen Adaptation
- Home screen adapts circular UI elements based on screen width
- UI elements scale proportionally to screen size
- Text sizes remain consistent for readability

## Implementation Example
From [home_screen.dart](mdc:lib/screens/home_screen.dart):
```dart
// Get screen size
final size = MediaQuery.of(context).size;

// Use relative sizing for UI elements
Container(
  width: size.width * 0.65,
  height: size.width * 0.65,
  // ...
)
```

## Safe Area Usage
- SafeArea widget protects content from device notches and system UI
- Ensures UI elements are not obscured by system elements

## Orientation Support
- Layouts should function in both portrait and landscape where appropriate
- Use orientation-aware layouts for screens that need to adapt significantly

## Device-Specific Adjustments
- Use MediaQuery to detect smaller devices and adjust UI accordingly
- Implement scrolling for content that might not fit on smaller screens

When implementing new screens or modifying existing ones, always ensure that the UI remains usable and visually appealing across different device sizes by following these responsive design principles.
