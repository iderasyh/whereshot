# App Features

WhereShot is an app that detects locations from photos. These are the primary features and their implementations:

## Location Detection
- Users can upload photos to identify the location where they were taken
- The app processes image data to extract location information
- Location detection processing happens through the [location_detection_provider.dart](mdc:lib/providers/location_detection_provider.dart)

## Image Management
- Photo selection from device gallery using the `image_picker` package
- Optional photo storage based on user preferences
- Image processing with size and quality optimization
- Maximum image dimensions defined in `AppConstants`

## Credit System
- Users have credits that are consumed when using the service
- Credits are displayed as a floating badge on the home screen
- Credit packs can be purchased through the store screen
- Credits are managed through the [user_provider.dart](mdc:lib/providers/user_provider.dart)

## User Accounts
- User authentication and profile management
- User preferences storage (e.g., default save mode for images)
- User credit balance tracking

## History Management
- The app can maintain a history of previously identified locations
- Historical data is managed through the [history_provider.dart](mdc:lib/providers/history_provider.dart)

## Store Functionality
- In-app purchases for credit packs
- Different credit pack tiers with various pricing
- Visual indication of recommended/best value packs

## Navigation
- App navigation handled by Go Router
- Routes defined in [app_router.dart](mdc:lib/router/app_router.dart)
- Named routes for consistent navigation

When implementing new features, ensure they integrate properly with existing ones and follow the established patterns for state management, UI design, and error handling.
