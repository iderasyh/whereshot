# UI Design System

This app follows a consistent UI design system to ensure visual coherence throughout:

## Theme Configuration
- Centralized theme definition in [app_theme.dart](mdc:lib/theme/app_theme.dart)
- Material 3 design enabled with `useMaterial3: true`
- Custom color scheme defined in `AppColors` class
- Standardized spacing system in `AppSpacing` class
- Consistent border radius values in `AppRadius` class

## Color Usage
- Primary color: Electric blue accent (`Color(0xFF007AFF)`)
- Alternative accent: Coral accent (`Color(0xFFFF7A5C)`)
- Background: White (`Color(0xFFFFFFFF)`)
- Text: Dark grey (`Color(0xFF222222)`)
- Supporting colors for various UI states (error, success)

## Spacing and Layout
- Spacing constants: xs (4.0), s (8.0), m (16.0), l (24.0), xl (32.0), xxl (48.0)
- Consistent padding and margins using the spacing system
- Responsive layouts using MediaQuery and relative sizing

## Text Styles
- Typography defined in the theme's `textTheme`
- Headings, body text, and labels have consistent sizing and weights
- Text colors use the app's color system

## Components
- Card design with consistent elevation and border radius
- Button styles (elevated, outlined, text) with standardized appearance
- Input fields with standardized padding and styling
- Custom painters for decorative elements (e.g., [PatternPainter](mdc:lib/screens/home_screen.dart))

## Special Effects
- Custom animations for UI elements
- Subtle background patterns
- Shadow effects with consistent blurRadius and color

When implementing new UI components, follow these design principles and utilize the existing theme system rather than hardcoding values. This ensures a consistent user experience throughout the app.
